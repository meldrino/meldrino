# Meldrino — Roadmap

## Phase 1 — Development Environment
Set up all tools needed to build and manage the project: Flutter, Android Studio, VS Code, Git, GitHub repository, and a PowerShell script to commit and push project files to GitHub at the end of each session.

## Phase 2 — Basic App
Build the home screen with a single coin (Nano). Each row displays: coin icon | coin name | wallet | fiat value | ticker. Rows sorted by fiat value, highest first. Coins held in more than one wallet are flagged — tapping the flag reveals a breakdown and offers an optional combined total.

## Phase 3 — Coin Detail Screen
Tapping a row opens a detail screen showing: price movement graph, whether the coin is held in multiple wallets and the option to see a combined total, and whether any NFTs exist on that blockchain.

## Phase 4 — NFT Support
Add the ability to view NFT images. Home screen gains an NFT icon alongside the existing home button for navigation.

## Phase 5 — Additional Coins and Wallets
Expand to support more coins and wallets including non-custodial wallets. Coin list sourced from a DEX. Users add their own wallet addresses and details.

## Phase 6 — Monetisation
3-month free trial with a countdown timer visible at all times. On expiry, the app stops working. Payment is crypto-only. Mechanism to prevent the free trial resetting on reinstall.

## Phase 7 — iOS Port
Port the Flutter app to iOS and resolve any platform-specific issues.

## Phase 8 — Publish
Submit to Google Play Store and Apple App Store. Launch and promote.

## Phase 9 — Venture Capital
Approach VCs with traction data. Pitch: AI-powered discovery engine to autonomously locate and integrate new coins, chains, and wallets without developer intervention.

## Phase 10 — Take the Money and Run
