We are working on a project together that you have forgotten all about. 
Firstly you need to read 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meldrino/meldrino/main/roadmap.md
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meldrino/meldrino/main/README.md
we have done phase one I have installed all the prerequisites such as flutter and we have the ps1 script
we have finished phases 1 and 2 and ran out of tokens on phase 3. The main.dart was getting bloated so we split the functions into other dart files, all of which are ‘loose’ in the C:\meldrino_app\lib folder
app_bar.dart
coin_detail_screen.dart
coin_holding.dart
home_screen.dart
main.dart
manage_wallets_screen.dart
nano_service.dart
price_service.dart
settings_screen.dart
currently not all the top menu items are appearing.
